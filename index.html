                    YES! In fact, if you are connecting to the internet through your own laptop we would recommend using a VPN client for secure access to company intranets and mail servers. Check that your company VPN supports NAT traversal and allows multiple connections from a single IP address. Check with your IT staff. Please ensure that you are logged in through the portal page before you use your VPN.

            b) You will not be eligible for any compensation if you cannot use the Service because of power or equipment failure, routine maintenance or circumstances outside of WiFi SPARK's control including downtime due to the failure of an internet service provider's connection. If, however, the Service is not available for reasons other than the above, please contact WiFi SPARK's Customer Service on 0344 848 9555 for a possible refund or credit of time.

            d) You shall indemnify WiFi SPARK for any breach of clause (c), above, 
             
            e) You agree that you will not use the WiFi SPARK service for:
